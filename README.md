#AGE OF EMPIRES WITH AI README#

###Project Overview:###
"Age-of-Empires-with-AI" is a project where artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are implemented in a real-time strategy (RTS) game similar to the classic "Age of Empire." This endeavor aims to explore and compare the effectiveness of various AI strategies within the game environment, using Java and Netbeans as the development platform.

Key Features:
* Implementation of AI algorithms in an RTS game setting, providing a dynamic and challenging gameplay experience.
* Investigative review on the performance of four distinct AI algorithms: Monte Carlo, Minmax, Alpha-beta, and Megamax, offering insights into their relative efficiencies and decision-making processes in the game.
* Enhanced game intelligence, making the gameplay more engaging and competitive for players.

Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: Java
- Development Environment: Netbeans
- AI Algorithms: Monte Carlo, Minmax, Alpha-beta, Megamax
